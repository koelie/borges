Dear candidates,

Thank you very much for your interest to work with us at Borges.xyz and taking the time for this assessment. We realise that your time is valuable, so we've taken care to make an assigment that we hope is feasible but challenging, yet not over-demanding. Eddy Bruël is our lead developer, and he will guide you through the assessment. He also suggested that you write an algorithm to select the best candidate, but I think that this is not within scope (yet) because it will be a very difficult and  human decision :) If, however, you feel you have another, better goal or interpretation of the requested task, then please don't hesitate to discuss with us on slack. 

We have set up a slack account where you can find us, and for which you will receive an invitation shortly. IMPORTANT:If you want to remain anonymous, please use the candidate moniker suggested by the invitation. On the slack, you will also see the (anomymised) channels of the other candidates. We ask you urgently to only use our private channels to communicate and not those of the other candidates. Eddy is available on weekdays from 9-15:30, I myself am available from 9-5, and after that I'll check the slack irregularly. If you're stuck or if you have urgent matters to discuss, you are free to contact me from 9:00-20:00 on my mobile, at 0643144165.

You will find the data for this assessment here: https://we.tl/DePVendYWC

The data consists of 2000 3d shapes of vases and bowls. In the 'data' directory, you'll find png and stl files, and the datafields that were used to generate the shapes using the Borges geometry server API. In case you want to use the API, a script that illustrates its usage is provided in the scripts directory.

The first assessment is to train a neural network that classifies images as representing a 'bowl' or a 'vase' (possibly of lower resolution than the ones given) that were of course not used during training. It would be very interesting to see if you can already recognize vases from photographs found online, f.i. by training on edge-detection filtered versions of the png images.

A secondary challenge is to generate new shapes in a non-trivial way (the trivial way being simple interpolation)

It’s important to realise that we don’t expect you to have all the answers. we're interested in your ability to balance when to figure things out on your own, and when to ask for help. So if you have any questions about the assignment, or are unsure how to proceed, don’t hestitate to ask! (However, keep in mind that I (Eddy) might not always be able to answer right away)..

Please create a repository on your own account on github (please make one if you don't already have it) and let Eddy know where he can find your repo. The protocol will be that you let Eddy know on the private slack channel when you start your assessment, and everytime you commit/push to your repository. Eddy will check these messages twice a day, around noon and at the end of the day, check your commit and and provide feedback, and ask/answer any questions he/you might have. 

We ask you to work on this for no more than 3 days, and we understand that you may not be able to allocate this much time directly, therefore we set the deadline for our evaluation process to Monday 11th of December at 09:00. You may start your assessment at any time from tomorrow. Again, we value your time and we want to stress that we do not expect to see mountains of code or as many features and achievements as possible, but rather a well documented and communicated small project. We understand that some aspects of this assessment may not be within your current skillset, but we expect you to communicate this and determine the proper course of action in cooperation with Eddy. The skills that we are looking for are (in random order):

- creativity 
- communication
- awareness of modern development process (structured commits and pushes, 
  with the understanding that these are reviewed)
- writing understandable and maintainable code

Good luck, have fun (!), and we're very much looking forward to see the results.
